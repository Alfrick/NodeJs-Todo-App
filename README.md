# NodeJs-Todo-App

This is the entire code for a simple Todo app in Node.js. The application allows users to add and delete items to a list.
Whenever an item is added the list, it's stored on a database and displayed on the interface.
Clicking on any item removes it from the list. 

## Technologies used in this application

* Node.js
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* MongoDb and Mongoose
* Jquery Ajax

I'm grateful to [@Shaun](https://github.com/iamshaunjp) for his lessons that enabled me to create this application.
